Ideaâ€™s spark anywhere and at any time. From dreams to shower thoughts, anyone has the ability to come up with a good idea. The problem is, as easy as it is to think, it is much easier to forget. Most thoughts and ideas stay with us for a limited amount of time unless reminded upon. 

This is where FlowNotes comes in. Our main focus is to bring peoples thoughts and Ideas to fruition by creating a quick, simple, and organized note app. Unlike other basic note-taking apps, FlowNotes is powerful, fast, and responsive while also being easy to use. 

This app was built in Android Studio. We first designed the inference using XML and then individually programmed the interface using JAVA. Finally, we merged all of our activities and Java files together and troubleshooted all of the remaining problems. 

Our largest hurdle during our 36 hours was programming in Android Studio since it was a new experience for us. Merging branches to put everything together since we were all working on different areas, was one of the most difficult parts since Android Studio is not properly optimized for github collaboration.
